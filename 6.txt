                                                                Building & testing

Run the following command in the same directory as docker-compose.yml to build the services:

    - docker-compose build

And now run the following to create and start the containers:

    - docker-compose up

You can optionally run the following to achieve the same result:

    - docker-compose up --build


Once these 3 steps are done, go on http://localhost:80/ads_count/<int:id>
